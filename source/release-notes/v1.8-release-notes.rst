--------------


Upgrading from v1.7
-------------------

Before upgrading to v1.8, please consider the following:

- If upgrading from OnDemand 1.5.x or older **you must upgrade to 1.6.x before upgrading to 1.7**. See directions for upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5 (:ref:`v1.5-release-notes`) and from 1.5 to 1.6 (:ref:`v1.6-release-notes`).
- As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first to test and verify before you modify the *production* instance.


#. Update OnDemand release RPM

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.8/ondemand-release-web-1.8-1.noarch.rpm

#. Update OnDemand

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum clean all
      sudo yum update ondemand

#. (Optional) If previously using Apache's Basic Auth, for example with LDAP, it is recommended to switch to :ref:`Dex Authentication <dex-authentication>` by installing the ``ondemand-dex`` package.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install ondemand-dex

   .. warning::

      The configuration for Dex will need to be made to ``/etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml`` with your needed LDAP configuration and updates to both Dex and Apache configurations.
      See :ref:`Configuring OnDemand Dex for LDAP <dex-ldap>` for details on configuration of LDAP.


#. Update Apache configuration and restart Apache.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /opt/ood/ood-portal-generator/sbin/update_ood_portal
      sudo systemctl try-restart httpd24-httpd.service httpd24-htcacheclean.service

#. (Optional) If ``ondemand-dex`` was installed, you must enable and start the ``ondemand-dex`` service.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo systemctl enable ondemand-dex.service
      sudo systemctl start ondemand-dex.service

Upgrading from v1.6
-------------------

Due to changes with ``ood-portal-generator`` it is necessary to run ``update_ood_portal`` with ``--force`` flag
if upgrading from v1.6 of OnDemand to v1.8.


Details
-------

Default authentication is now handled by Dex
............................................

The default authentication mechanism for OnDemand is now using the OIDC provider `Dex`_.  The Dex authentication will replace Apache's Basic Auth.  Sites wishing to continue using LDAP authentication or other forms of Basic Auth are recommended to configure Dex.
See :ref:`Dex Authentication <dex-authentication>` for details on OnDemand Dex.

Support mod_auth_openidc configuration via ood-portal-generator
...............................................................

The Open OnDemand Portal :ref:`ood-portal-generator-configuration` file now supports defining `mod_auth_openidc`_ configurations directly.
